# What is a Mad Lib?
# Mad Libs is a fun word game where you build a silly story together. One player reads a story template with blanks, 
# asking others for random words (nouns, verbs, adjectives) to fill them in, without revealing the story itself. 
# Once all the blanks are filled, the first player reads the complete story aloud â€“ with all the crazy words everyone chose! 
# Mad Libs is a great group activity, perfect for parties or gatherings.

# steps
#1. create the madlib as a variable that contains the history (string). f"string that contains {variable}"
#2. create variables with its input.Example: city_name = input("City name:")
#3. put the variables in their corresponding places, these will sustitute the blank space in the history. 
#4. print (print is an instruction) the madlib variable

city_name = input("City name: ")
dog_name = input("Dog's name: ")
dog_profession = input("Dog's profession: ") 
place = input("Place: ")
objects = input("Object: ")
second_object= input("Another object: ")
animal = input("Animal: ")
